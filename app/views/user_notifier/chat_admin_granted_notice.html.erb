Congratulations! You have been granted chat admin status.

The only new ability this enables is 'ban', which is IP and session based. That cheese-log can come back later, let's hope with some more manners.

Please use this sparingly, with forewarning, and report to support@infrno.net afterwards with the user's info and appropriate details.

Thank you for helping us keep Infrno a friendly place!
