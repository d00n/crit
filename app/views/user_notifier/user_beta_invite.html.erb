Hello <%= @invitee_name %>!

<%= @inviter_name %> asked me send you an invite for Infrno. It's a socnet/virtual game table for playing table-top
RPGs over the internet. 

We're in private beta, and still in stealth, so please keep this under wraps.

Here's your invite:
http://infrno.net
beta invite code: <%= @beta_invite_code %>

The real meat of the site is the game table, which you can find by clicking 'Game table - PLAY GAME!' in the left nav on any game
profile of which you are a member or owner. However, the sample game is open to all:

We have also invented a brand new way to enjoy and show off your games: post-session, in-character blogging. Check out the blog on
Sorena's profile page:

Any and all feedback is highly appreciated.

Come get some!
Mike
